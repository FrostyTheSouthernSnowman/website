## About Me

- 🤖 I'm passionate about AI/ML, robotics, and space exploration.
- 🌱 Currently learning and experimenting with Tinygrad, Mojo, AI, and Arduino.
- 💡 I'm always on the lookout for exciting projects that can advance the field of AI and enhance my skills.
- 🚀 Exploring the universe, one curiosity at a time.

P.S. Currently in high school and will happilly consider any opportunities for internship, especially in AI or aerospace.

## My Projects

Here are some of the project(s) I'm currently working on:

- [Tinygrad](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad): Tinygrad is a small neural network library created by George Hotz and the Tinycorp with the goal of simplifying the requirements for chip makes to port neural networks to new hardware
- I am developing a system to move ferromagnetic objects in three degrees of freedom for use in microgravity applications. (Arduino based, no moving parts)
- I am also working on AGI, although currently still in planning phase.
